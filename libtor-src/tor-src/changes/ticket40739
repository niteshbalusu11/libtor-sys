  o Minor bugfixes (compression):
    - Right after compression/decompression work is done, check for errors.
      Before this, we would consider compression bomb before that and then
      looking for errors leading to false positive on that log warning. Fixes
      bug 40739; bugfix on 0.3.5.1-alpha. Patch by "cypherpunks".
